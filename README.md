View Tasks: Display all tasks with details like ID, title, description, and status.
Update Task: Modify the title, description, or status of an existing task.
Delete Task: Remove a task by its ID.
Data Persistence: Tasks are saved in a tasks.json file and persist between program runs.

Example tasks.json file:
